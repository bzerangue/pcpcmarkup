  # A simple implementation of partials.
  #
  # Renders the named Haml file and returns the generated HTML.
  # 
  # If the named file is not found, the suffixes +.haml+ and +.html.haml+ are
  # added and looked for, and then the same names but with the prefix +_+. The
  # first file found will be used.
  #
  # +self+ is used as the context, so instance variables can be used in the
  # partial and will have the same value as the parent template.
  #
  # This method makes no effort to cache the generated Ruby code, it simply
  # uses +Haml::Engine.new().render+ each time.
  #
  # @param partial [#to_s] the filename of the partial to render
  # @param locals [Hash] a hash of local variables to use in the partial
  # @return [String] the HTML generated from the partial
  # @raise [StandardError] if the partial file cannot be found
